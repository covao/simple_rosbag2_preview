# Simple rosbag2 preview

## Overview

This is a lightweight, browserâ€‘based tool to quickly preview the contents of a ROS2 bag database file (`*.db3`). It lists all available topics in the bag and provides simple perâ€‘topic statistics such as message count, time span, and estimated frequency.

The tool is implemented as a single HTML+JavaScript file. No server or ROS2 environment is required. Everything runs locally in your browser using [sql.js](https://sql.js.org/) to read the SQLite database format used by rosbag2.
